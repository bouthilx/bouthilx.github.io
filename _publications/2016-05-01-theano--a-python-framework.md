Theano is a Python library that allows to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical
expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. Since its introduction, it
has been one of the most used CPU and GPU mathematical compilers - especially in the
machine learning community - and has shown steady performance improvements. Theano is
being actively and continuously developed since 2008, multiple frameworks have been
built on top of it and it has been used to produce many state-of-the-art machine
learning models.  The present article is structured as follows. Section I provides an
overview of the Theano software and its community. Section II presents the principal
features of Theano and how to use them, and compares them with other similar projects.
Section III focuses on recently-introduced functionalities and improvements. Section IV
compares the performance of Theano against Torch7 and TensorFlow on several machine
learning models. Section V discusses current limitations of Theano and potential ways of
improving it.
