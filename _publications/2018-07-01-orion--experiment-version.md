We present Oríon, a new black-box optimization tool currently in development that is
designed to adapt to the workflow of machine learning researchers for minimal
obstruction. We propose a new version control system for experiments, which can
significantly improve the organization of research projects in machine learning as well
as the efficiency of hyperparameter optimization. The entire tool is built with the goals
of promoting reproducibility, fair benchmarking of different machine learning models, and
providing a platform for the research of black-box optimization algorithms.
