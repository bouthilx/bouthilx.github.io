How do machine-learning researchers run their empirical validation? In the context of a
push for improved reproducibility and benchmarking, this question is important to
develop new tools for model comparison. This document summarizes a simple survey about
experimental procedures, sent to authors of published papers at two leading conferences,
NeurIPS 2019 and ICLR 2020. It gives a simple picture of how hyper-parameters are set,
how many baselines and datasets are included, or how seeds are used.
