The apparent contradiction in the title is a wordplay on the different meanings
attributed to the word reproducible across different scientific fields. What we imply is
that unreproducible findings can be built upon reproducible methods. Without denying the
importance of facilitating the reproduction of methods, we deem important to reassert
that reproduction of findings is a fundamental step of the scientific inquiry. We argue
that the commendable quest towards easy deterministic reproducibility of methods and
numerical results should not have us forget the even more important necessity of
ensuring the reproducibility of empirical findings and conclusions by properly
accounting for essential sources of variations. We provide experiments to exemplify the
brittleness of current common practice in the evaluation of models in the field of deep
learning, showing that even if the results could be reproduced, a slightly different
experiment would not support the findings. We hope to help clarify the distinction
between exploratory and empirical research in the field of deep learning and believe
more energy should be devoted to proper empirical research in our community. This work
is an attempt to promote the use of more rigorous and diversified methodologies. It is
not an attempt to impose a new methodology and it is not a critique on the nature of
exploratory research.
