An important class of problems involves training deep neural networks with sparse
prediction targets of very high dimension D. These occur naturally in e.g. neural
language models or the learning of word-embeddings, often posed as predicting the
probability of next words among a vocabulary of size D (e.g. 200,000). Computing the
equally large, but typically non-sparse D-dimensional output vector from a last hidden
layer of reasonable dimension d (e.g. 500) incurs a prohibitive O(Dd) computational cost
for each example, as does updating the Dxd output weight matrix and computing the
gradient needed for backpropagation to previous layers. While efficient handling of
large sparse network inputs is trivial, this case of large sparse targets is not, and
has thus so far been sidestepped with approximate alternatives such as hierarchical
softmax or sampling-based approximations during training. In this work we develop an
original algorithmic approach that, for a family of loss functions that includes squared
error and spherical softmax, can compute the exact loss, gradient update for the output
weights, and gradient for backpropagation, all in O(d^2) per example instead of O(Dd),
remarkably without ever computing the D-dimensional output. The proposed algorithm
yields a speedup of D/4d, i.e. two orders of magnitude for typical sizes, for that
critical part of the computations that often dominates the training time in this kind of
network architecture.
