How do machine-learning researchers run their empirical validation? In the context of a push for
improved reproducibility and benchmarking, this question is important to develop new tools for model
comparison. This document summarizes a simple survey about experimental procedures, sent to authors
of published papers at two leading conferences, NeurIPS 2019 and ICLR 2020. It gives a simple
picture of how hyper-parameters are set, how many baselines and datasets are included, or how seeds
are used.
