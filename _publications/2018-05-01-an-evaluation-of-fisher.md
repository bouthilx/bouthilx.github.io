We study two coarser approximations on top of a Kronecker factorization (K-FAC) of the
Fisher information matrix, to scale up Natural Gradient to deep and wide Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs). The first considers the activations (feature maps) as spatially
uncorrelated while the second considers only correlations among groups of channels. Both
variants yield a further block-diagonal approximation tailored for CNNs, which is much
more efficient to compute and invert. Experiments on the VGG11 and ResNet50
architectures show the technique can substantially speed up both K-FAC and a baseline
with Batch Normalization in wall-clock time, yielding faster convergence to similar or
better generalization error.
