I am a fifth year PhD student in computer science at Mila, Université de Montréal, under the
supervision of Pascal Vincent, specializing in machine learning, most specifically deep learning. I
am strongly interested by both research and software development.

During my Master and PhD I did research on wide array of subjects ranging from NLP, Computer Vision,
optimization to theoretical deep learning. I am now concentrating on studying the methodology for
deep learning research, looking for ways to improve reproducibility.

Beside research, I have been an important contributor to tools developed at LISA/Mila such as Theano
and Pylearn2 and a mentor for students contributing to these projects. I am now leading the project
Oríon, a platform for hyper-parameter optimization, which is fundamental in my quest to improve
methodology in deep learning research, and I am developing an automation tool called Mahler, which
enables large scale experimentations for improved reproducibility using statistical tests.
