I am a Research Scientist at Mila, dedicated to enabling cutting-edge research
by improving access to computational resources. My work centers on two key
projects: Milabench, a benchmark for GPU-intensive AI pipelines to support
hardware acquisition decisions, and SARC, a monitoring tool for decentralised
HPC resources to ensure optimal usage of our computational resources.

I earned my PhD from the Université de Montréal, under the supervision of Pascal
Vincent, where I laid the foundation for my expertise in benchmarking and
reproducibility in AI pipelines. During my Master’s and PhD I also explored a
wide range of topics, including NLP, Computer Vision, optimization, and
theoretical deep learning.

I am deeply passionate about benchmarking and evaluation, striving to ensure the
reliability and robustness of systems through rigorous testing. Beyond my
research, I am an avid developer and a strong advocate for open-source software.

# I am a sixth year PhD student in computer science at Mila, Université de
# Montréal, under the supervision of Pascal Vincent, specializing in machine
# learning, most specifically deep learning. I am strongly interested by both
# research and software development.

# During my Master and PhD I did research on a wide array of subjects ranging from
# NLP, Computer Vision, optimization to theoretical deep learning. I am now
# concentrating on studying the methodology for deep learning research, designing
# methods to improve reproducibility.
# 
# Beside research, I have been an important contributor to tools developed at
# LISA/Mila such as Theano and Pylearn2 and a mentor for students contributing to
# these projects. I am now the lead developer of the project Oríon, a platform for
# hyper-parameter optimization, supported by the Mila IDT team and for which we
# are currently signing collaboration agreements with the industry.
