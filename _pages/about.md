I am a Research Scientist at Mila, dedicated to enabling cutting-edge research
by improving access to computational resources. My work centers on two key
projects: Milabench, a benchmark for GPU-intensive AI pipelines to support
hardware acquisition decisions, and SARC, a monitoring tool for decentralised
HPC resources to ensure optimal usage of our computational resources.

I earned my PhD from the Université de Montréal, under the supervision of Pascal
Vincent, where I laid the foundation for my expertise in benchmarking and
reproducibility in AI pipelines. During my Master’s and PhD I also explored a
wide range of topics, including NLP, Computer Vision, optimization, and
theoretical deep learning.

I am deeply passionate about benchmarking and evaluation, striving to ensure the
reliability and robustness of systems through rigorous testing. Beyond my
research, I am an avid developer and a strong advocate for open-source software.
